# vgg16

Ah, VGG16! That's a well-known convolutional neural network architecture used in deep learning for image recognition and classification. It's part of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) family of models developed by the University of Oxford.

Here are some key features of VGG16:

16 Layers: It consists of 16 weight layers (13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers).

Small Filters: Uses 3x3 convolution filters, which helps in capturing fine details in images.

Deep Network: Despite being deep, the network has a simple and uniform structure
